// The module declaration. This states the entry points that we handle. The
// macro takes care of the marshalling of arguments and dispatch.
//
// Anyone can have these functions execute by signing and submitting
// an extrinsic. Ensure that calls into each of these execute in a time, memory and
// using storage space proportional to any costs paid for by the caller or otherwise the
// difficulty of forcing the call to happen.
//
// Generally you'll want to split these into three groups:
// - Public calls that are signed by an external account.
// - Root calls that are allowed to be made only by the governance system.
// - Inherent calls that are allowed to be made only by the block authors and validators.
//
// Information about where this dispatch initiated from is provided as the first argument
// "origin". As such functions must always look like:
//
// `fn foo(origin, bar: Bar, baz: Baz) -> Result;`
//
// The `Result` is required as part of the syntax (and expands to the conventional dispatch
// result of `Result<(), &'static str>`).
//
// When you come to `impl` them later in the module, you must specify the full type for `origin`:
//
// `fn foo(origin: T::Origin, bar: Bar, baz: Baz) { ... }`
//
// There are three entries in the `system::Origin` enum that correspond
// to the above bullets: `::Signed(AccountId)`, `::Root` and `::Inherent`. You should always match
// against them as the first thing you do in your function. There are three convenience calls
// in system that do the matching for you and return a convenient result: `ensure_signed`,
// `ensure_root` and `ensure_inherent`.
